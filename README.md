##### The Vending Machine Application allows users to insert a specified amount of money, and purchase different products with the money inserted.

<p> The vending machine is stocked by reading from a file in local storage, and users are able to view a list of all products, as well as the quantity in stock. Once the user chooses an amount of money to purchase items with, they can choose from the list, and the item will be dispensed, decreasing the quantity by 1 for that item. Users can purchase multiple items, and view their remaining balance. Once the user completes the transaction, a message is displayed depending on which items were purchased, and the remaining balance is returned in change. Each purchase is logged to a file in local storage, sorted by date and time.</p>
